# Heart-Disease-Predictor
Heart-Disease-Predictor is a machine learning project that analyzes patient health data such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure to predict the risk of heart disease. It includes preprocessing, multiple ML models, and visual insights to support smarter health decisions.


This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.

🚀 Features

1.Preprocessing and cleaning of health-related datasets
2.Training machine learning models for disease prediction
3.Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics
4.Saving and exporting trained models for future use
5.Interactive and user-friendly workflow via Jupyter Notebook


🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python 3.x → The heart of the project, powering everything behind the scenes
📊 NumPy & Pandas → For making sense of raw health data and turning it into something useful
🤖 Scikit-learn → Where the real “learning” happens — training and testing our models
📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn → To bring data stories to life with clear and colorful visuals
💾 Joblib → To save our trained models so we can reuse them anytime
